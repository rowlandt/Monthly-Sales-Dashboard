The dashboard displays KPIs such as sales, profits, average discount, and quanity of products sold in the selected months. 

Superstore sells furniture, office supplies, and technology to consumers, corporate, and home offices throughout the United States. Sales data range from January 2019 to December 2022. 

To compare the monthly performance of Superstore between products a dashboard was designed to visualize key performance metrics, daily trends for the month of sales, percentage of sales per segment, and top ship mode. 
 

An Excel file was uploaded into Tableau where all data analysis was conducted and was able to create an interactive Tableau dashboard. 

* Used parameters and filters to make dashboard dynamic and interactive. 
* Created calculated fields.


Through this analysis Superstore executive board and manager are able to compare sales between individual products from one month to the next. Allowing them to see is sales increase, decrease, or stay the same. Chairs for example so a dramatic increase between the months of April and May. This could be due to the change in weather in Spring and more activities are being scheduled outdoors.
